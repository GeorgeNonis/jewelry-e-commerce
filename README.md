<p>
      <h3>Simple Frontend project with Typescript & React.js.
            This project was a challenge by itself as I had to push myself in term of design and CSS skills.
            Something that was a big lesson from this project was the fact that I had to change the way the menu and cart
            was being displayed on different devices! Also connected to Stripe with dummy backend res.
